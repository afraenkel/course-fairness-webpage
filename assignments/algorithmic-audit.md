Write a paper that audits/analyzes an algorithmic decision making
system that you build (and may serve as a basis of comparison with a
real world system). This audit should go beyond an observational
analysis and leverage ~2 topics discussed in the
second half of the course:

* Inframarginality and threshold testing
* Intersectionality analysis
* Individual Fairness analysis
* Preprocessing, In-processing, and Post-processing for fairness
* Selective labels problem
* Feedback Loop modeling, simulation, and analysis
* Unsupervised representation analysis

This paper will require a lot more code and quantitative analysis than
the first.

You are encouraged to continue with the subject-matter you began
studying in paper 1. You will meet with course staff during week 8 to
propose a plan for your paper.
