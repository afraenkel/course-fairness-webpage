Write a paper that audits/analyzes an algorithmic decision making
system. This system may be a real-world "live" system, a system/algorithm
described in a publication, or a system that you build. This audit
should go beyond an observational analysis and leverage one of the
models discussed in the second half of the course (causal reasoning,
threshold testing, feedback loop analysis, or insupervised
representation analysis).

You are encouraged to continue with the subject-matter your began
studying in paper 1.

More details later (week 06).
