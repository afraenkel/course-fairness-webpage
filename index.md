# Introduction

This course examines the greater context under which the practice of
Data Science exists and explores concrete ways issues of fairness
surface in the technical work of a Data Scientist. Much of the work of
a Data Scientist contribute to decision making processes, either
through algorithmic systems or informing policy. The course will
survey frameworks for studying the objectives and impacts of such
decisions, paying particular attention to how such decisions affect a
diverse population of individuals.

The course will ground, motivate, and contextualize these frameworks
in the experiences of individuals and communities impacted most by
decision making systems. As participants in the course, we will relate
to these individuals through the critical lens of our own
experience. Concretely, the course will dedicate significant time to the
study of particular histories and contexts of marginalized individuals
and communities as a necessary component of any analysis of these
decision making systems.

# Learning Objectives

At the end of the course, student will be able to:

* Identify sources and impacts of the 'limits of measurement' via
  reasoning about context, considering qualities lost in the data
  collection process.
* Critique the strengths and weaknesses of quantitative concepts that
  attempt to model commonly held values related to fairness.
* Compare and constrast the implications of considering different
  contexts under which a decision making system may be judged (social,
  legal, business) and describe the impacts such decisions have on
  the people with whom it interacts.
* Write a data-driven analyses of a decision making system, critiquing
  specific limitations of the analysis, and identifying the values
  that the quantitative analysis attempts to capture.
* Create, then audit, a decision making system, while considering and
  evaluating the implications of choices made during the process on
  those that the system impacts.

Together, these objectives form a toolkit that students can use in
critically analyzing the impacts of a decision making system, diagnose
potential sources of bias, and constructively discuss the implications
of decision choices in terms of values and the harms incurred by others.

# Topics Covered

The course will broadly cover the following topics:
1. Frameworks for understanding the impacts of algorithmic decision
   making systems and the contexts under which they operate. These
   include a discussion of distributive theories of justice,
   discrimination, harms. We will emphasize connections between these
   frameworks and the limitations of measurement and classification.
2. Identifying inequity in data; understanding limitations in such
   identification.
3. Identifying sources of bias in the Machine Learning pipeline from
   the point of view of a data scientist and ways of approaching this
   bias in practice.
4. Following the impact of made decisions, including the amplification
   of bias through feedback loops and reinforcing power structures.
5. Identifying representational harms, with particular attention paid
   to quantitatively identifying such harms in natural language and
   images.

# Course Methods

The methods used in the course regularly incorporate experiential and
practical approaches to solidify and expand understanding of the
course's lecture-based, topical material. A few of these methods are
outlined below:

1. Weekly reading responses on which you reflect on your experiences
   in comparison to the experiences told in the readings.
1. Engaging in weekly discussion with other students (via reading
   responses) that encourage understanding others points of view.
1. Focusing on the origins and context of marginalized individuals and
   groups in the United States that are most likely to experience
   unfair algorithmic decisions.
1. Engaging in a focused study of a prominent inequity in San Diego,
   California, or the United States, including a thorough undestanding
   of the context and evaluation of the measurements (data) used to
   draw conclusions.
1. Practice doing the work of a Data Scientist, critically examining
   your decision-making system's impact on its users while weighing
   the implications of possible design decisions decision (paper-2).

# Course Expectations

This course is interdisciplinary by design. Assignments necessitate
reading papers from the humanities and social sciences, deriving
probabilistic/statistical models, and writing code. I assume you
have some exposure to all of these areas through DSC 80 and standard
exposure to critical reasoning typical of an upper-division
course. However, much of the material in this course will require
pushing yourself to understand topics outside your comfort zone; a
curious, open mind, with a healthy amount of perseverance is most
important. 

The goal in this course is to meaningfully engage with and relate to
the material; it's not necessary to understand every line of your
reading. Start by carefully reading the abstract, introduction, and
conclusion (skimming the rest). Later, read over the work in its
entirety. If you are still finding understanding a topic difficult,
you should ask your classmates, then reach out to the instructor or
TA!

### Guidelines for Respectful Conversation

This course will also approach high-stakes and controversial
topics. These discussions may occur during lecture, section, among
student conversations in breakout rooms, or in peer reviews. Learning
to have respectful discussions about such topics is a valuble life
skill for a data scientist, who tends to interact with a wide variety
of people.

Here are a few guidelines for respectful conversation we will follow in
this course:
* Listen respectfully, without interrupting.
* Listen actively and with an ear to understanding others'
  views. (Donâ€™t just think about what you are going to say while
  someone else is talking.)
* Criticize ideas, not individuals.
* Commit to learning, not debating. Comment in order to share information, not to persuade.
* Avoid blame, speculation, and inflammatory language.
* Allow everyone the chance to speak.
* Avoid assumptions about any member of the class or generalizations
  about social groups. Do not ask individuals to speak for their
  (perceived) social group.

### Attendance

The course may be taken asynchronously. Lectures will be
prerecorded and posted on Canvas for viewing at any time. However,
*real-time lecture attendance is highly encouraged*. We will have
'watch parties' during scheduled lecture times:
* The prerecorded lecture will be played in a Zoom meeting during the
  scheduled lecture time.
* I will be present to answer real-time questions in the chat.
* Lecture will contain discussion slides that we will discuss as a class
  (not-recorded) in breakout rooms.
* I will have office hours immediately after the schedule lecture for
  those who want to hang around and discuss the material.

If you participate in the class asynchronously, please watch lecture
within 24 hours of the scheduled lecture to stay up-to-date with the
weekly readings.

# Assignments

## Weekly Reading Responses 

Each week, complete the reading assignment found in the
[schedule](#schedule) and write your response to the given prompt by
Mondays at 11:59PM. 

Upon submission of the reading response, you must
complete your assigned peer review by the following Wednesday at
11:59PM. These assignments are graded on a 0-2 scale.


*Grade: 20% of Total*

## Identification of Inequity 

Write a paper that identifies and analyzes a potential inequity in the
world, using data. You may either replicate a known publication or
find a topic yourself. See the
[assignment](assignments/inequity-analysis).

This project may be worked on in pairs.

*Grade: 40% of Total*

## Algorithmic Audit

In this paper, you will:
1. build an algorithmic decision making system (in the area you wrote
   about in paper-1) and
2. audit the system / study the impacts on the population on which it
   decides.
   
The audit may lead to studying different approaches to potential
unfair decisions by the system. Your analysis must at least 2 of the
topics covered in the second half of the course. See the
[assignment](assignments/algorithmic-audit).

This project may be worked on in pairs.

# Academic Integrity


In this course we expect students to adhere to the UC San Diego
Integrity of Scholarship Policy. This means that you will complete
your work honestly, with integrity. Some examples
of specific ways this policy applies to DSC 167 include:
* All writing must be your own (or that of your group partner).
* Thoroughly cite all ideas and work that is not your own.
* Any code that you write must be developed by you.
* Discussing concepts among classmates is encouraged! However, any
  work derived from such discussion should come from only you, after a
  healthy pause to digest the conversation.
