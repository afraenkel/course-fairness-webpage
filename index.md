# Introduction

This course examines the greater context under which the practice of
Data Science exists and explores concrete ways these issues surface in
technical work. Two parallel threads run through the quarter:

* Readings will introduce different frameworks for understanding how
  individuals relate to social institutions.
* Case studies identify how these concepts arise in the "life of a
  Data Scientist" and using them to propose and critique potential
  "solutions".

# Course Expectations

This course is interdisciplinary by design. Assignments necessitate
reading papers from the humanities and social sciences, deriving
probabilistic/statistical models, and writing code. I assume you
have some exposure to all of these areas through DSC 80 and standard
exposure to critical reasoning typical of an upper-division
course. However, much of the material in this course will require
pushing yourself to understand topics outside your comfort zone; a
curious, open mind, with a healthy amount of perseverance is most
important. 

The goal in this course is to meaningfully engage with and relate to
the material; it's not necessary to understand every line of your
reading. If you are finding this difficult, you should reach out to
the instructor or TA!

### Guidelines for Respectful Conversation

This course will also approach high-stakes and controversial
topics. These discussions may occur during lecture, section, among
student conversations in breakout rooms, or in peer reviews. Learning
to have respectful discussions about such topics is a valuble life
skill for a data scientist, who tends to interact with a wide variety
of people.

Here are a few guidelines for respectful conversation we will follow in
this course:
* Listen respectfully, without interrupting.
* Listen actively and with an ear to understanding others'
  views. (Donâ€™t just think about what you are going to say while
  someone else is talking.)
* Criticize ideas, not individuals.
* Commit to learning, not debating. Comment in order to share information, not to persuade.
* Avoid blame, speculation, and inflammatory language.
* Allow everyone the chance to speak.
* Avoid assumptions about any member of the class or generalizations
  about social groups. Do not ask individuals to speak for their
  (perceived) social group.

# Topics Covered

The course will broadly cover the following topics in sequence:
1. Introduction, definitions, and context
2. Identifying inequity in data
3. (Un)Fairness across the machine learning pipeline
4. A closer look at decision making
5. Advanced topics

Throughout the course, we will pay particular attention to the
following themes:
* The limits of measurement ('all data are cooked').
* The new (and old) problems surfaced by the *algorithmic* component
  in the decision making considered in the course.
* How these topics surface in a variety of contexts (legal, social),
  in a variety of decision-making paradigms (scoring models,
  information retrieval), with a variety of data types (text, image,
  tabular, geospatial).
* Reasoning about the impact that a decision-making model has on the people with whom it interacts.

# Assignments

## Weekly Reading Responses 

Each week, complete the reading assignment and write your response to
the given prompt by Mondays at 11:59PM. Upon submission of the reading
response, you must complete your assigned peer review by the following
Wednesday at 11:59PM. These assignments are P/NP.

See the [reading response assignment](assignments/reading-response)
for details.

*Grade: 20% of Total*

## Identification of Inequity 

Write a paper that identifies and analyzes an inequity in the
world. You may either replicate a known publication or find a topic
yourself. See the [assignment](assignments/inequity-analysis).

This project may be worked on in pairs.

*Grade: 40% of Total*

## Paper Review / Replication 

Write a paper that audits/analyzes an algorithmic decision making
system. This system may be a real-world "live" system, a system/algorithm
described in a publication, or a system that you build. See the
[assignment](assignments/algorithmic-audit).

Grade: 40% of Total
