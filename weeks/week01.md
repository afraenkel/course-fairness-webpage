## Reading (Required)

### Introduction

This article summarizes current status of AI Fairness within the
context of business, arguing it's not just an ethical issue, but also
an issue of quality.

* [Harvard Business Review: AI Fairness Isn't Just an Ethical
  Issue](https://hbr.org/2020/10/ai-fairness-isnt-just-an-ethical-issue)
  by Greg Satell and Yassmin Abdel-Magied
  
We will read a few chapters in the book Data Feminism, which argues
for an broader awareness of surrounding sociological context when
working with data.

  (Introduction)
  by Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein
    
### What is fairness?

This article claims makes the argument that there is nothing
intrinsically wrong with inequality, it's absolute defencies in
welfare that matter. This article should help understanding the next
two. We will read more about this in later weeks.

* [People Don't Actually Want
  Equality](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/10/people-dont-actually-want-equality/411784/)  

This introduction to a book on equality and justice gives a rough
overview of different notions of equality of opportunity.

* [The Demands of Equality: An Introduction](https://klinechair.missouri.edu/docs/vol_2_demands_of_equality.pdf)

This entry in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is long and
dense, but gives a feel for how philosophers think about these
topics. Don't worry if the text loses you a bit, but do be able to
summarize the main point of each section.

* [Distributive Justice](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-distributive/), Sections 1-4.

## Reading (Optional)

A nice overview of bias in machine learning for an audience of
computer scientists:
* [Kate Crawford: The Trouble with
  Bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggzWIipKraM) (NeurIPS 2017)

The [Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/) is a good resource to learn
about philosophical concepts. Particularly useful entries for this
course are:
* [Equality of Opportunity](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/equal-opportunity/)
* [Egalitarianism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/)

## Reading Response Questions

Answer the following questions and turn your writing on Canvas. Please
consider the applicable [Guidelines for Respectful
Conversation](https://afraenkel.github.io/fairness-algo-decision/#guidelines-for-respectful-conversation)
when writing your responses, as the course staff and your peers (via
peer-review) read your responses.

* Pick one of the first two readings. Summarize a main point from that
  reading that you found interesting and its most convincing
  supporting argument/example. Also note any objections you may have
  to this main point or interesting subtleties to the point the author
  had to consider.

* From the 'Distributive Justice' article: Explain the difference
  between Rawl's two principles of justice (section 3) and the 'luck
  egalitarian ideal' (section 4), give a illustrative example of the
  difference, and write your opinion of which seems a more reasonable
  notion of justice.
