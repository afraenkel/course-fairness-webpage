## Reading Responses

From the Heidari piece:
1. Explain the difference bewteen the overall utility, actual utility,
   and effort-based utility. Give an example to distinguish them.
2. Pick *one* of Propositions 1,2,3 (read/understand them carefully)
   and interpret the utility functions that correspond to the parity
   measure in question. Use an example to clarify your
   explanation. (The interpretation given in the paper, after each
   proposition may be helpful).

From the Scanlon piece:
1. Summarize the main argument of the reading
2. Give a supporting argument the author uses
3. Discuss any objects you may have or subtleties the author must deal
   with.
