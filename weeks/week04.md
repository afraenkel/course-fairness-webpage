## Reading Responses

From Fair ML Book:
* From the 'Inherent Limitations of Observational Criteria':
  - What is the main point made by this section.
  - How does Scenario I/II makes this main point?
  - Think of your own example, using a different classifier, that
    illustrates this point.
    
* From Ezra Klein piece:
  - What are the decision making classifiers he considers?
  - What are the harms? Allocative or Representational (or both)?
  - What are the utilities being considered?
  - Discuss the interplay between algorithmic decision and the
    decisions that consititute direct harms? How does he view
    repsonsibilities for the impacts of these decisions?
