## Topics

* Limits of Parity Measures: Infra-Marginality, Intersectionality, Causality

## Reading (Required)

Simoiu, Corbett-Davies, and Goel describe the impact that different
distributions of behaviors can have on decision making and how parity
conditions sometimes incorrectly point toward non-existent
discrimination. This article is accessible, clear, and includes a
detailed walk-through of the concept through an analysis of the
effects of predictive policing on Black communities.

* [The Problem of Infra-Marginality in Outcome Tests for Discrimination](https://5harad.com/papers/threshold-test.pdf)

Parity Measures requires *classifying* individuals into defined
groups. The politics of how those groups are defined matters.

## Reading (Optional)

This article describes the phenomenon of 'Fairness Gerrymandering', in
which a model constrained to be 'fair' will naturally move unfairness
to carefully divided subgroups of people defined through
intersectionality.

* [Preventing Fairness Gerrymandering:Auditing and Learning for Subgroup Fairness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05144.pdf)

This article proposes an approach to measuring fairness for
individuals that identify with multiple salient groups
(intersectionality):
