## Topics

* Limits of Parity Measures: Infra-Marginality, Intersectionality, Causality

## Reading (Required)

Simoiu, Corbett-Davies, and Goel describe the impact that different
distributions of behaviors can have on decision making and how parity
conditions sometimes incorrectly point toward non-existent
discrimination. This article is accessible, clear, and includes a
detailed walk-through of the concept through an analysis of the
effects of predictive policing on Black communities.

* [The Problem of Infra-Marginality in Outcome Tests for Discrimination](https://5harad.com/papers/threshold-test.pdf)

Parity Measures requires *classifying* individuals into defined
groups. The politics of how those groups are defined matters.

## Reading (Optional)

This article describes the phenomenon of 'Fairness Gerrymandering', in
which a model constrained to be 'fair' will naturally move unfairness
to carefully divided subgroups of people defined through
intersectionality.

* [Preventing Fairness Gerrymandering:Auditing and Learning for Subgroup Fairness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05144.pdf)

This article proposes an approach to measuring fairness for
individuals that identify with multiple salient groups
(intersectionality):

## Reading Responses

* In the Infra-Marginality Paper, carefully re-read the section on
  *Omitted variable bias* (page 1211). In the COMPAS dataset, we have
  the variables [here](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2702103-Sample-Risk-Assessment-COMPAS-CORE.html). Which of these variables may have a similar
  effect on the differences in distributions between COMPAS scores for
  Black vs. White defendants? Why?

* In *Data Feminism*:
1. Summarize the main argument of the reading
2. Give a supporting argument the author uses
3. Discuss any objects you may have or subtleties the author must deal
   with.
