## Topics

* Approaching fairness across the ML Pipeline

## Reading (Required)

This paper approaches pre-processing a dataset via 'label-flipping'
and 're-weighting', in order to impose demographic parity:

This paper using the in-processing approach of adding a penalty to the
loss function to better learn fair model parameters:
