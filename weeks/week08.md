## Topics

* The gap between model output and decisions; amplification of bias and feedback loops

## Reading (Required)

This blog post looks at how judges *use* the COMPAS risk score in
practice, and how it differs from the assumptions we make about
idealized algorithmic decisions:

* [If You Give a Judge a Risk Score](https://thelittledataset.com/2019/07/15/if-you-give-a-judge-a-risk-score/)

This article examines the problem of 'selective label' bias:

* [The Selective Labels Problem: Evaluating Algorithmic Predictions in
  the Presence of Unobservables](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3097983.3098066)

This article defines a theoretical model to illustrate how, beginning
with very slight existing bias, algorithmic systems will usually
converge to an extremely biased steady-state. This model explains the
reinforcement of existing inequities in police interactions.

## Reading (Optional)

This law-review article provides a comprehensive background to the
discussion in the *If You Give a Judge a Risk Score* reading.

* [Asseessing Risk Assessment in Action](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3016088)

This article surveys approaches to *batch model updates* of healthcare
models that are retrained on prior decisions:
