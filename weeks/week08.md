## Topics

* Amplification of Bias and Feedback Loops; Echo chambers.

## Reading (Required)

This article defines a theoretical model to illustrate how, beginning
with very slight existing bias, algorithmic systems will usually
converge to an extremely biased steady-state. This model explains the
reinforcement of existing inequities in police interactions.

* [Runaway Feedback Loops in Predictive Policing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.09847.pdf)

This Review of Safiya Noble's "Algorithms of Oppression" discusses the
dynamics and ultimate impacts of representational harms propogated
through feedback loops.
